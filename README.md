### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

When I think on my early years, I have always been passionate about technology and curious about how things work.

During high school I discovered the programming world. I started with basic HTML, then continued expanding my information in technology experience through the years. During these years I learned to create entire websites not only for myself, but for others.

From 2011 to 2015, I was part of an indie team based in Bologna, Italy (Black Raven). We developed small games and programs for iOS and PC. I was responsible for the design and development of the website and methods of database connection of the apps. As a secondary role, I also worked as a 3D modeler.
The years spent as part of this team enhanced my programming skills and developed the dynamics of working with a team. Thanks to this experience, I have become the programmer I am today.

In May 2015, I was offered the opportunity to work at a web agency (Magic), where I was trained on how companies develop websites and e-commerce platforms. During my three years with the company, I expanded my knowledge of WordPress, Drupal, and Magento.

In June 2018, I moved to London to expand my knowledge and increase my English language skills.
After a couple of months I joined Purr, a web agency based in central London. Since starting, there have been many interesting projects and new ways of building websites that I had never previously explored.

In May 2022, I joined Soundpickr and started working with Laravel and React to build a music streaming service. Sadly this startup shut down at the end of 2023 because of lack of foundings.

In January 2024, I joined CyberDuck (recently acquired by CACI) as a backend developer and started working mainly  on Worcester Bosch, a gigantic Laravel project.
